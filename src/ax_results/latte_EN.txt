<h1>Latte macchiato</h1>
<p>Latte macchiato has a splash of milk that breaks the acidity, giving it a more neutral flavor compared to the overwhelming taste of bitterness in a regular espresso. It carries the distinct strong taste of espresso. The luxurious velvety taste distrincts the latte macchiato from other drinks. Latte Macchiato is also called "stained milk" because of how it is prepared, which is to “stain” the milk with espresso. The origin can be traced back to Italy. Latte macchiato is best paired with crêpe and oatmeal cookies.</p>
