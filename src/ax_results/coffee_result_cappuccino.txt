<h1>Cappuccino</h1>
<p>Cappuccino is mild and creamy at the first taste from the generous ratio of milk to coffee. Having cappuccino as a base introduces you to a bold yet smooth flavor. Though this drink is layered, it each flavor suits eachother and creates a wonderful mix of flavors that would leave you energized yet relaxed by the luxurious velvety taste. </p>
<p>Cappuccino got its name from the Capuchin Monks due to the drink�s similarity to the color of the monk�s robes when the drink is mixed with milk. It was first made in Vienna back in 1901 but it wasn&#x27;t recorded until the 1930s. It is made with whipped cream and is sprinkled with chocolate or cinnamon on top. Today, it is still called �Kapuziner� in Austria. </p>

The fresh flavors of fruit sit well with the hints of bitterness giving you a wonderful combination of flavors that greatly compliments each other . If you if you prefer sweet or neutral tasting food and desserts, choco lava-cake, brownies, oat cookies, croissants, or chocolate pastries are also good choices to choose from. </p>
